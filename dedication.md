>It was like looking down into a new world. At our feet, cradled amid a vast confusion of
mountains, lay a small valley bright as a gem, but opening southward on our right. Through
that opening there was a glimpse of warm, blue lands, hills and forests, far below us. The
valley itself was like a cleft in the Mountain's southern chin. High though it was, the year
seemed to have been kinder in it than down in Glome. I never saw greener turf. There was
gorse in bloom, and wild vines, and many groves of flourishing trees, and great plenty of
bright water — pools, streams, and little cataracts. And when, after casting about a little to
find where the slope would be easiest for the horse, we began descending, the air came up to
us warmer and sweeter every minute. We were out of the wind now and could hear
ourselves speak; soon we could hear the very chattering of the streams and the sound of
bees.

> "This may well be the secret valley of the god," said Bardia, his voice hushed.
  
> "It's secret enough," said I.
  
> Now we were at the bottom, and so warm that I had half a mind to dip my hands and face in
the swift, amber water of the stream which still divided us from the main of the valley. I had
already lifted my hand to put aside my veil when I heard two voices cry out — one, Bardia's. 
I looked. A quivering shock of feeling that has no name (but is nearest terror) stabbed
through me from head to foot. There, not six feet away, on the far side of the river, stood
Psyche.
